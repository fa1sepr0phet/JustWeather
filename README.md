## Why JustWeather?

Most weather apps are overloaded with ads, trackers, subscriptions, bloated web views, and data-hungry SDKs.

JustWeather takes the opposite approach:

- No advertising SDKs
- No analytics SDKs
- No user accounts
- No subscriptions
- No paywalls
- No third-party tracking
- Weather data from the National Weather Service
- Saved locations stored locally on-device
- Fully open source under GPLv3

## Privacy

JustWeather is designed with privacy as a core feature, not an afterthought.

The app does not include advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs. It does not require an account and does not sell, share, or monetize user data.

Location access is optional and used only to retrieve weather for the user’s selected area.

For more detail, see [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Network Requests

JustWeather makes network requests only for weather and location functionality.

Primary service:

- `api.weather.gov` — National Weather Service weather forecast data

Possible system-level service:

- Android `Geocoder` — used for address lookup; the backend may depend on the device, Android version, or OEM.

JustWeather does not send data to analytics, advertising, crash-reporting, or tracking services.
